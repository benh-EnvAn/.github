# Contributing to repositories at DfT

The following is a set of guidlines taken from the GitHub standards document for creating and contributing to repos at DfT

## What I should know before I start

### Github standards

The Github standards documnet describes best practice when using the platform, advising on common processes that ensure that we protect the department and oursleves for any mishaps that may result in awkward meetings without any coffee. Make sure you have read the document and are confident with its contents and any obigations you may have. Any questions should be raised through the community of practice, tech leads, or any of the points of contact identified.  

### Undstanding roles and responsibilities 

The Github standards document describes the roles of Contributor, Repository Lead, Project Lead, or Technical Lead. Make sure whichever you are using one is identified for the repo you are creating or contributing to.  

### Code of Conduct

All repos at DfT are governed by the [DfT code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) by creating and participating you are expected to uphold this code. Please escalate any unacceptable behaviour through the usual channels. 

### Using templates

Where possible use the templates provided. If these don't cover exactly what you need then raise an feature request (with the template provided :-)) as this could be something that someone else might find useful as well. 

## Contributing 

### Team specifics

Each team at DfT may have their own naming conventions, templates, and preferences. Make sure you are familiar with what is required in the area of work in which you find yourself.  

### Is it clear

Whether submitting a PR, raising a bug report, or a feature request use clear and concise titles, language, and descriptions. 

#### Hopefully this sets the tone of what is expected when using repos at DfT 

If anything is missing from this document raise a feature request or if you have any questions reach out to the Github contacts within the department.
